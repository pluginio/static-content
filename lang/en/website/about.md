## We do this for fun!

The Plugin.IO core team are located in Manchester, UK. Our love of social is unsurpassed! Our mission set, to build the world's first crypto-social web3.0 network on decentralized tech. Our mission was born out of frustration and our own desires to leave mainstream social networks, to provide better user data policies, greater freedoms and to lead the effort of helping social creators earn revenue from their content.

<br />

## Core values

<br />

### Trust

At Plugin.IO, we have adopted an industry leading position of trust with our users. Our guiding principles are founded on the idea that privacy is a fundamental human right and that the collection of personal data should to be limited accordingly. Unlike other social network services, Plugin.IO will never sell your personal data, build large behaviour profiles or use tracking cookies in any form.

Our collective vision is that technology should be an incredible tool for good. Our mission is to enable our users to pursue individual liberty and to improve the human condition for all.

<br />

### Innovation

Whilst our core services borrow from many features of web 2.0, we are fully committed to ideals of decentralization and web 3.0. This includes the integration of various digital currencies and NFTs as well as wallet identities and decentralized p2p asset hosting.

As we continue to innovate in the creative and social space we will deliver services that advance real-world application. As we move away from native platforms, we understand the importance of innovating to provide high impact user experiences on cross-platform technology.

<br />

### Environmental responsibility

As a digital currency and blockchain company, we take environmental impact very seriously. We made a clear decision to avoid any 'proof of work' consensus for our NFTs and also for NEKO, our prospective utility coin. Plugin.IO uses a private and permissioned blockchain in conjunction with industry leading trust authorities.

Plugin.IO pledge 5% of all net profits to environmental good causes that work towards global net-zero emissions targets. We will provide our annual report at: [https://plugin.io/net-zero](https://plugin.io/net-zero)
