## ‚ú≥Ô∏è Introduction
<hr />

<br />

Plugin.IO believe that you should always know what data we collect and that you should have meaningful control over how that data is used. Plugin.IO does **NOT** want your personal data, instead we want you to be aware of how other companies abuse your trust.

<br />

> You should read this privacy policy in full, but here a a few key points that you should take away from it:

<br />

- Plugin.IO is a public service and your content is made available immediately. Your public content is viewable and searchable by anyone around the world. We provide non-public methods of communication. You can use Plugin.IO with a pseudonym rather than your real name and advise you to do so.

- When you use Plugin.IO, even if you a not a registered user, we receive some data such as the type of device that you're using and your IP address. We use this information to secure user accounts and prevent abuse and fake accounts as well as providing more relevant content.

- We give you control to manage your personal data [settings](https://plugin.io/settings). Here you can control things like account security, 2FA and data related preferences. We **NEVER** sell your data or pass data to third-party developers, publishers or advertisers.

- If you have any question about this policy, how we collect or process personal data or anything related to this privacy policy, you can [contact us](#privacy-contact-us) any time.

## ‚ú≥Ô∏è Information You Share With Us
<hr />

<br />

> Plugin.IO requires users to have an account to use services such as uploading or sharing content.

<br />

<a name="basic-information"></a>

## Basic Account Information

To use some Plugin.IO service, it's not necessary to create an account. Services such as searching and viewing public content are available to everyone. If you choose to create a Plugin.IO account, you must provide us some personal data so that we can provide you with our services. You must provide a username, for example **@pluginio**, a password and an email address and phone number for 2FA. Your username is always public, and Plugin.IO suggest that you use a pseudonym rather than your real name. You can create and manage multiple Plugin.IO accounts, for example to manage different sales channels.

<br />

<a name="public-information"></a>

## üî∏ Public Information

Almost all activity on Plugin.IO is public. This includes your profile information, and certain information about your content such as time and date of publication. If you like, share or reply to a post, this information is publicly available and used to improve the delivery of content to you. This is achieved using heuristics and Plugin.IO does not keep a direct record of your engagement with our services to target content to you. Information about you might be posted by other users such as mentioning you in a public post.

You are responsible for content added to our services, and you should always be careful about what you make public, especially information that is sensitive or can be used to identify you personally.

By publicly posting content to Plugin.IO, you are instructing us to disclose that content as broadly as possible, on the Plugin.IO website, via third-party applications and publisher websites.

<br />

<a name="direct-messages"></a>

## üî∏ Direct Messages

Plugin.IO provides features that allow users to communicate using direct messages. When you communicate with other users via direct messages, we store and process them for purposes such as link shortening using [huk.to](https://huk.to), spam prevention, the detection of prohibited images and when acting on reported issues. We only share direct messages with their intended recipient. Please remember that when you send direct messages, the recipient of those messages have their own copy that can persist. Even if you delete your copy of a message, a recipient may duplicate, share or store that message content.

<br />

<a name="payment-information"></a>

## Payment Information

Plugin.IO uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) for all payments. You can learn about how Stripe handles your data from the Stripe [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy). We never stores any of your payment or billing information.

<br />

<a name="manage-privacy-settings"></a>

## üî∏ Manage your Privacy Settings

You can manage how you want Plugin.IO to handle certain types of private data in your [privacy settings](https://plugin.io/settings). Here you can decide things like:

- Whether other users can tag you in posts and images
- Whether users can find you based on your email address
- What type of content you want to restrict
- Whether you want to receive direct messages from friends and/or followers
- Whether you want to block or mute other Plugin.IO users.
