# Plugin.IO referral program

The referral program lets you earn a revenue share for each friend (“invitee”) who signs up and generates revenue using your personal signup link.

<br />

**How to earn revenue**

1. Visit the [Invite page](https://plugin.io/invite) to get your referral link.

2. Use any of the share methods provided or copy and share your invitation link in an email, social network, text message or via your favorite messaging app.

3. Your friends can open the invitation link in the message and sign up for a [Plugin.IO account](https://plugin.io/register).

4. Your friend must complete their account set-up and receive a payment via any of the various monetization methods provided by Plugin.IO.

5. You will receive a revenue share of completed sales up to $50 per friend invitation.

<br />

**I haven’t received my referral payment**

Here are a few possible reasons you might not be eligible for the referral program.

* The invitee must sign up using your unique referral link. This means they need to create a new Plugin.IO account directly after opening your link.

* We do not make referral payments on duplicate or false accounts. Duplicate or shared financials will cause disqualification.

<br />

**More details**

* You can share your referral link via email, social networks, text message, or any of your favorite messaging apps like Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter.

* Referral links are a link to Plugin.IO with a special code on the end that makes your link unique. For example: https://www.plugin.io/invite/YOUR_USERNAME_ID

* There is no limit to the number of friends you can refer, however there may be limits on the amount of referral bonuses you can receive.

<br />

**Terms & conditions**

Promoting your referral code through the use of paid advertising on 'Plugin.IO' or Plugin.IO related keywords is prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, bidding or running ads on search brand keywords that include 'Plugin.IO' or similar variations and using 'Plugin.IO' branded terms in your ad copy, is not appropriate. Referrers who engage in such activities will have their referral codes deactivated and all referrals resulting from such activities are ineligible for referral payments.

<br />

***Important Notice:***

Unfortunately we can't guarantee payout on every account you refer due to the limitations mentioned above and risk of fraud, but we make a good faith effort to do so whenever possible. In addition, Plugin.IO reserves the right to change the terms of the referral program at any time due to changing market conditions, risk of fraud, or other reasons. By participating in the referral program you acknowledge that receiving payouts is not guaranteed by Plugin.IO.
