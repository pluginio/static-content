# Whitepaper - Working draft

[PLUGIN.IO](https://plugin.io)

### Last updated: June 20th, 2022

<br />

# Abstract

We describe a comprehensive utility cryptocurrency, app store, marketplace and smart contract framework that simplifies the trade of digital and physical goods and services. We base our proposal upon a public, permissioned and decentralized, proof of stake (PoS) blockchain. State is managed by distributed consensus.

The current cryptocurrency market serves investors but lacks supporting infrastructure that facilitates effective trade of goods and services. Historically, goods and service trade are known to contribute to economic growth and increased economic stability, whilst also encouraging asset liquidity. <sup>[[1]](#1)</sup>

<br />

> Plugin.IO is a crypto-centric social network. Our goal is to provide low cost NFTs and practical means to trade and track ownership of digital and physical property, apps, games and services. Creators, developers, publishers and suppliers have access to a unified social platform that focuses on crypto-monetization, accessibility, privacy and user experience.

# ‚ú≥Ô∏è Introduction

Current blockchain technologies present barriers to entry through complexity. The current generation of frontend tools often focus on wallets or fragmented and exclusive trading platforms for digital assets.

There is opportunity to simplify and enable mainstream adoption of NFTs by automating crypto-transactions with a distributed web and social media content system.

<br />

> Plugin.IO is a unified SaaS platform and developer SDK that facilitates trade of NEKO, our native cryptocurrency and NFTs.

**Cryptocurrencies present a number of advantages for investors, these include:**

### Autonomy

Digital currencies can offer greater autonomy as users can spend their money without the necessity of an intermediate authority.

<br />

### Lower transaction fees
    
Whilst some cryptocurrencies may charge maker, taker or withdrawal fees, most cryptocurrencies do not incur traditional bank fees. This keeps transaction fees very low. Likewise, travellers that wish to transact across jurisdictions and international boundaries can benefit from reduced transaction fees.

<br />

### Always-on trading

Unlike other trading marketplaces, cryptocurrency markets do not have set trading hours and are able to handle trade at all times.

<br />

### Accessibility

Users are able to transfer cryptocurrencies using only a smartphone or computer with an internet connection. This means that services are accessible in areas where traditional banks, credit and debit card access or ATMs are not available.

## üî∏ Target Market

As a crypto-centric social marketplace, Plugin.IO aims to appeal to users that want to monetize their social content. Plugin.IO enables users to sell and purchase creative works, subscriptions and goods from affiliate sales channels.

The Plugin.IO SDK provides API features that help developers to monetize their applications and games through direct sales, in-app-purchases (IAPs), subscriptions and/or advertising.

Our minimal data collection policy appeals to users that are increasingly aware of privacy concerns regarding data breaches that lead to personal data leaks. Plugin.IO only collects personal data that is required by law and/or used to recover or protect a users account from unauthorized access as well as anonymized data for purposes of spam prevention.

<br />

## üî∏ Initial Coin Offering (ICO)

Initial coin offerings are playing an ever increasing role in financing options and offer an excellent alternative to raising venture capital (VC).

As a crypto-social platform, there is a clear opportunity that an ICO presents. ICOs have become an effective way for new cryptocurrency models to raise seed finance by issuing tokens that represent an underlying asset.

## üî∏ NFTs
A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain, that certifies any digital asset to be unique. <sup>[[10]](#10)</sup>

NFTs function like a cryptographic token but are not mutually interchangeable, and therefore they are not fungible. In 2020, the NFT market tripled to more than USD$ 250 million <sup>[[11]](#11)</sup> with notable sales of individual works reaching $USD 69.3 million <sup>[[12]](#12)</sup>
